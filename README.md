The database provides information on life expectancy in 101 countries worldwide, using various variables. Each record in the data table represents a country for which data across different indices were collected. We conducted several linear regression models and statistical analyses to predict life expectancy based on demographic characteristics.

The repository has three kinds of files:

1. Excel Data
2. R files with the code
